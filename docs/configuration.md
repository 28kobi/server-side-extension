# Configuring SSE plugins in Qlik Sense

You must configure SSE plugins, referred to in Qlik Sense as analytic connections, in the Qlik Management Console (QMC) or using the Qlik Repository Service API. After you add a new analytic connection, you must restart the Qlik engine. 

For an overview of analytic connections, see __Analytic connections__ the Qlik Sense Developers help:
